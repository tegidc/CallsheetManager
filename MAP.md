# Code Map — index.html

Update this map whenever a function is added, renamed, or moved — as part of the existing phase verification checklist.

Entries are anchored to function/variable names (not line numbers, which go stale). Grouped by the app's tabs, with a shared section for cross-tab utilities.

Module-level UI state variables (`crewDB`, `editingCrewId`, `collapsedDepts`, filter-open flags, …) are deliberately not listed — this map covers functions and the canonical constants.

See also the **Section codes** table at the bottom: short handles (T-1, T-2.2, D-1, …) for the tabs/sections/tools themselves, for naming a screen without describing it in prose.

## Canonical lookups — use these, don't re-derive

Every screen needs the same handful of records. These are the single place that knows how to find each; reaching past them with an inline `.find`/`.filter`/`.sort` is what lets sort order and fallbacks drift between screens (and is how the tech-specs export bug went unnoticed).

- `projById()` / `currentProject()` — a project by id / the currently open one — [Shared/utility functions]
- `crewById()` / `dayById()` / `locById()` — a crew member / shoot day / location by id, `null` if missing — [Shared/utility functions]
- `currentDay()` — the shoot day currently being edited or previewed — [Shared/utility functions]
- `projectDays()` — a project's shoot days, always in day order (defaults to the open project) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `projectCrew()` — a project's crew records, in the order they were added to it — [Shared/utility functions]
- `projectOf()` — the project a given shoot day belongs to — [Shared/utility functions]
- `selectedDayLocation()` — the location currently picked in the Shoot Day form's primary-location select — [Shoot Days]
- `refreshCrewDatabase()` — full re-render of the Crew Database screen (its filter/sort/admin controls live outside `#crewList`, so `renderCrewList()` alone isn't enough) — [Crew]

## Overview

- `renderProjectOverview()` — renders the project overview tab body (client, title, dates, logline, description form) — [Overview]
- `saveProjectOverview()` — validates and persists overview fields (client/title/start date required), updates sidebar/header on save — [Overview]
- `bareMinimumWarningsHTML()` — builds the "bare minimums" warning pills (missing dates/locations/crew) with click-to-fix jumps — [Overview]
- `renderWelcome()` — renders the landing screen shown when no project is open — [Overview]
- `resetAndReseed()` — wipes and reloads sample data for a fresh demo state — [Overview]
- `seedSampleData()` — populates the databases with sample crew/locations/projects/days for demo purposes — [Overview]
- `renderNewProject()` — renders the "create new project" form — [Overview]
- `previewProjCode()` — live-previews the generated project code while filling in the new-project form — [Overview]
- `createProject()` — validates and saves a new project record, then opens it — [Overview]
- `renderProject()` — top-level render for an open project (header + tab body) — [Overview]
- `renderProjectBody()` — dispatches to the correct tab renderer based on `currentProjectTab` — [Overview]
- `deleteProject()` — deletes a project and its shoot days after confirmation — [Overview]

## Crew

- `renderProjectCrew()` — renders the project Crew tab, including the grid-view switcher (Roles/Days/Hotel/Travel/Catering), the shared header row and the bulk-action bar — [Crew]
  - `crewGridView` switch renders one of: roles grid, days-on-site grid, hotel grid, travel grid, catering grid
  - Phase V: Select all/Filter/Expand-all/Summary were unified into one `.crew-header-row` (Select all + Filter left-aligned, Expand/Collapse-all toggle + Summary right-aligned, one shared font) built once in this function and reused identically across all five view-switcher tabs. The Filter *toggle* lives in this row; the Filter *panel* (`projectCrewFilterPanelHTML()`) still renders as its own block below the row, not inside it, so opening it can't distort the row's alignment
- `setCrewGridView()` — switches which crew matrix (days/hotel/travel/catering) is shown and re-renders — [Crew]
- `toggleAllProjectDeptsCollapsed()` (Phase V) — the single Expand-all/Collapse-all toggle used in the crew header row: flips based on current state (expand if every visible group is collapsed, otherwise collapse all) rather than offering two separate always-on links; delegates to `setAllProjectDeptsCollapsed()` — [Crew]
- `projectCrewFilter` / `projectCrewFilterOpen` — the ONE shared filter/sort/group-by state for "Crew on this project", global so it survives `setCrewGridView()` tab switches. Now also holds `days` (Set of shoot day ids) and `daysMode` ('or'/'and') — the multiselect Days filter (Phase T item 3) — [Crew]
- `matchesCrewFilterState()` — shared match rules (depts, lead company, roles, exclude-Talent, exclude-other-companies) used by both this screen's filter and the Crew database's. Does NOT include the Days filter — the Crew database screen has no project/shoot-day context, so that's a separate check (`personMatchesProjectDayFilter`) only applied on the project screen — [Crew, Shared/utility functions]
- `personMatchesProjectDayFilter()` — the Days filter (Phase T item 3): matches if the person has a position on any (`daysMode:'or'`) or every (`daysMode:'and'`) of the selected shoot days. An OR/AND `<select>` appears next to the day checkboxes once 2+ days are picked — [Crew]
- `personMatchesProjectFilter()` / `personHasHotel()` / `sortProjectCrewGroup()` / `buildProjectCrewGroups()` — filter (`matchesCrewFilterState` + `personMatchesProjectDayFilter`), "has hotel" test, in-group sort and dept-or-hotel grouping for the assigned crew list — [Crew]
- `toggleProjectCrewFilterPanel()` / `toggleProjectFilterDept()` / `toggleProjectFilterRole()` / `toggleProjectFilterDay()` / `setProjectFilterField()` / `toggleProjectFilterFlag()` / `clearProjectCrewFilter()` / `projectCrewActiveFilterCount()` / `projectCrewFilterPanelHTML()` — collapsible filter panel state and rendering, including the Days filter-chips + OR/AND select (Phase T item 3) — [Crew]
- `projectCrewSelected` / `toggleCrewSelected()` / `toggleSelectAllFilteredCrew()` / `clearCrewSelection()` / `bulkRemoveSelectedFromProject()` / `bulkActionBarHTML()` — bulk-select (checkbox swapped in for the view/eye icon via `crewIdentityHTML`'s `bulkSelect` option) and the bulk "Remove from project" action. `toggleSelectAllFilteredCrew()` is the "Select all" checkbox next to Expand/Collapse all (Phase T item 2) — it's always handed exactly the currently-filtered/visible crew ids, never the full project roster, so it only ever selects what the active filter is showing — [Crew]
- `selectedEditTargets(crewId)` (Phase Bulk Edit) — **the selected-set bulk-edit pattern.** Every per-field editor on the Crew tab calls this first: if `crewId` is part of the current multi-select AND at least one other person is also selected, it returns every selected id; otherwise just `[crewId]`. The caller then loops its own field-specific mutation over the returned ids and does ONE `saveDB`/render at the end — this is the reusable "which ids does this edit apply to" decision, not a per-field bulk-edit implementation. Wired into `toggleCrewOnDay()` (Days on site), `toggleHotelNight()` / `toggleHotelPre()` (Hotel), `toggleMeal()` (Catering), `setTravelMethod()` (Travel), `saveQuickShowAs()` (Roles — Show as) and `setActiveRole()` (Roles — role/department; only on a direct user pick, i.e. `skipSave` falsy — the internal `skipSave:true` calls used to reactivate a replacement role after `removeRoleFromCrew()` do NOT fan out, since that's a single-person consistency fixup, not a user edit). `bulkActionBarHTML()` shows a one-line hint ("Editing a field for one selected person applies it to all N") whenever 2+ are selected. Deliberately NOT wired into `toggleAllForPerson()` / `toggleAllMealForPerson()` (the per-person "All" button) — that's a different axis (all days for one person), mixing it with cross-person propagation would be confusing — [Crew]
- `bulkEditOpen` / `toggleBulkEdit()` / `bulkEditPanelHTML()` / `applyBulkLeadCompany()` — bulk-edit panel opened from the bulk-action bar; currently just Lead Company, the field Phase R moved off the main Roles row — [Crew]
- `crewRolesRowHTML()` — renders one person's row in the Roles tab as a proper tidy grid (`.roles-grid`, Phase S), not a packed inline row: CONTROLS (checkbox + Edit pencil) | Name | Role (saved-roles taglist only — no add-role picker here any more) | Department (read-only, `deptLabelHTML`) | Show as. "Add a saved role" and Lead Company both live only in the Edit/pencil expansion (`crewFormHTML`) or the bulk-edit panel; phone is not shown on this row at all — [Crew]
- `showAsQuickEditHTML()` / `saveQuickShowAs()` — inline "Show as" quick-edit, used on the Roles row. Renders via the same `.icon-btn` pencil button as every other edit affordance in the row (Phase S item 2) rather than a separately-styled control — [Crew]
- `groupedCrewOptionsHTML()` — builds `<option>` groups (by department) for crew-picker selects — [Crew]
- `crewAssignRowHTML()` — renders one crew row in the "days on site"/"hotel" grid. Department badge and Lead Company pill are hidden (Phase S item 6) and role display falls back to Show-as (`showAsOrRole`, item 8) — this row no longer offers any role editing (the old per-row role quick-edit was removed; role/department/Show-as are only ever edited on the Roles tab) — [Crew]
- `toggleCrewOnDay()` — toggles a crew member's assignment to a given shoot day — [Crew]
- `crewCateringBlockHTML()` — renders one crew member's per-day breakfast/lunch/dinner checkbox rows in the catering grid. Department/Lead Company hidden, role display is Show-as-or-role, display-only (Phase S) — [Crew]
- `getCateringMeals()` / `toggleMeal()` — read/write which meals a crew member is down for on a given day — [Crew]
- `toggleAllMealForPerson()` — toggles one meal type on/off across every day for a person — [Crew]
- `buildCateringExport()` / `renderCateringExport()` / `copyCateringExport()` — build, render and copy a per-day catering headcount + dietary-notes list. Lives only in Preview & Export (T-6.5), left as-is by Phase P2 — [Crew, Preview & Export]
- `getCateringCosts()` / `saveCateringCosts()` — read/persist the project's per-meal costs (`p.cateringCosts.{b,l,d,delivery}`), Phase P2 — [Crew]
- `buildCateringSummaryGrid()` (Phase P2) — the Catering tab's own summary data: Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner counts per day plus a computed Daily cost (meal counts × their unit costs, plus a delivery fee charged once per meal type per day, only when that meal's count is >0 that day) — distinct from `buildCateringExport()`'s per-day list shape — [Crew]
- `cateringSummaryGridBodyHTML()` / `renderCateringSummaryGridSection()` (Phase P2) — render the grid (rows=meals+Daily cost, columns=days) into `#csmGridWrap`, re-rendered on cost-field input without touching the cost inputs themselves (same targeted-refresh pattern as `renderTechSpecsRoundup()`) — [Crew]
- `cateringSummaryOpen` / `toggleCateringSummaryBlock()` / `cateringSummaryHTML()` / `copyCateringSummaryGrid()` (Phase P2) — the collapsible "Catering summary" block on the Catering sub-tab (T-2.5): cost fields (Est. cost per Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner, Delivery cost) above the grid. Collapsed by default, positioned below "Crew on this project", same pattern as the Hotel summary block — [Crew]
- `jumpToCateringSummary()` (Phase P3) — the "Summary" jump-link next to Expand all/Collapse all on the Catering sub-tab: expands `cateringSummaryOpen` if collapsed, then scrolls `#cateringSummarySection` into view — [Crew]
- `crewTravelRowHTML()` / `setTravelMethod()` — render and update a crew member's travel method row. Department/Lead Company hidden, role display is Show-as-or-role, display-only (Phase S) — [Crew]
- `getTransportCosts()` / `saveTransportCosts()` (Phase W) — read/persist the project's transport cost inputs (`p.transportCosts.{publicPerDay,mileage}`): a flat daily rate for public transport and a single general mileage rate for people using their own car (one rate overall, not per-person) — [Crew]
- `buildTransportSummary()` (Phase W) — the Travel tab's own summary data: since travel method (`p.travelMethods`) is stored once per person per PROJECT, not per day, the per-day breakdown is derived by crossing each person's method with the days they're actually on site (has a position that day — same signal as the Days-on-site grid). Counts every method actually in use per day, plus a computed Daily cost (Own car count × mileage rate + Public transport count × daily rate — the only two methods that carry a cost; Train/Flying/Production transport/custom methods are counted but not costed) — [Crew]
- `transportSummaryGridBodyHTML()` / `renderTransportSummaryGridSection()` (Phase W) — render the grid (rows=methods in use+Daily cost, columns=days) into `#tsmGridWrap`, re-rendered on cost-field input without touching the cost inputs themselves (same targeted-refresh pattern as `renderCateringSummaryGridSection()`) — [Crew]
- `transportSummaryOpen` / `toggleTransportSummaryBlock()` / `transportSummaryHTML()` / `copyTransportSummary()` (Phase W) — the collapsible "Transport summary" block on the Travel sub-tab (T-2.4): cost fields (public transport cost/day, mileage rate) above the grid. Collapsed by default, positioned below "Crew on this project", same pattern as the Hotel/Catering summary blocks — [Crew]
- `jumpToTransportSummary()` (Phase W) — the "Summary" jump-link next to Expand all/Collapse all on the Travel sub-tab: expands `transportSummaryOpen` if collapsed, then scrolls `#transportSummarySection` into view — [Crew]
- `toggleHotelNight()` / `toggleHotelPre()` — toggle whether a crew member is booked a hotel room for a shoot night / the night before — [Crew]
- `abbreviateName()` — "first initial + last name" display form (e.g. "A. Shaw"), used by the per-night table's Names column — [Crew]
- `buildHotelSummary()` (Phase O, replaces the old Preview-tab `buildHotelExport`) — per-person hotel aggregation: resolves each person's actual booked-night dates (incl. "night before Day 1") into a check-in/check-out range and total-nights count, sorted earliest check-in first then most nights first (`orderIndex`), and reused by the per-night table's Names ordering so both views stay in the same person order — [Crew]
- `hotelSummaryOpen` / `toggleHotelSummaryBlock()` / `hotelSummaryHTML()` / `copyHotelSummary()` — the collapsible "Hotel summary" block: room-booking table (Room No./Name/Date from–to/Total nights) first, per-night table (Night/Rooms/Names) below it, no separate rooming list. Shared markup/state rendered in two places (Phase O + follow-up) — below the person × night matrix on the Hotel sub-tab (T-2.3), and again below the WhatsApp text block on Preview & Export (T-6.2b) — same `hsmb-summary`/`hsmc-summary` ids either way since only one tab body is ever in the DOM at once — [Crew, Preview & Export]
- `jumpToHotelSummary()` (Phase P3) — the "Summary" jump-link next to Expand all/Collapse all on the Hotel sub-tab: expands `hotelSummaryOpen` if collapsed, then scrolls `#hotelSummarySection` into view — [Crew]
- `toggleAllForPerson()` — toggles all day-assignment checkboxes for one person at once — [Crew]
- `addCrewToProject()` / `removeCrewFromProject()` — add/remove a crew member from the current project's roster — [Crew]
- `crewInfo()` — looks up a crew member's basic display info by id, with a fallback for removed crew — [Crew]
- `resolveCrewForDay()` / `hasOverride()` — resolve a crew member's effective role/dept for a specific day, accounting for per-day overrides — [Crew, Shoot Days]
- `dayOverrideFormHTML()` / `saveDayOverride()` / `clearDayOverride()` — render/save/clear a per-day override of a crew member's role/department/company — [Crew, Shoot Days]
- `OVERRIDABLE_FIELDS` — list of crew fields that can be overridden per shoot day — [Crew, Shoot Days]

## Locations

- `renderProjectLocations()` — renders the project Locations tab: the assigned-locations day grid, then the ONE "Add location" entry point — [Locations]
- `locAddOpen` / `locAddQuery` / `toggleLocAdd()` / `onLocAddInput()` / `locAddResultsHTML()` / `startNewLocationFromSearch()` (Phase Q) — **the unified add-location flow.** One button opens a search field over `locationsDB` (already-assigned locations filtered out, capped at 8 results), and the "create new location" option is the last row of that same result list, prefilled with whatever was typed. `onLocAddInput()` re-renders `#locAddResults` ONLY — re-rendering the tab would steal focus mid-word, the same reason `crewSearchQuery` lives outside the DOM. `startNewLocationFromSearch()` sets `locFormContext` to the project id itself, which is what makes `saveLocation()` attach the new record to `p.locationIds`. Replaces the old two-button arrangement (a database `<select>` + a separate "Add a new location" form) — [Locations]
- `locDayGridHTML()` — renders the per-location "which days is this used" checkbox grid — [Locations]
- `locRowHTML()` — renders one location row within a project — [Locations]
- `toggleLocOnDay()` — toggles a location's assignment to a given shoot day — [Locations]
- `addLocToProject(id)` / `removeLocFromProject()` — add/remove a location from the current project. Takes the id as an argument since Phase Q; the old no-arg form read a `#addLocPick` `<select>` that no longer exists — [Locations]
- `renderLocationsDatabase()` / `renderLocationsList()` — render the standalone locations database screen and its list — [Locations]
- `locFormHTML()` / `toggleLocForm()` / `closeLocForm()` — render/open/close the add-or-edit location form. `toggleLocForm()` is now the **Locations database screen only** and takes no project id (it always clears `locFormContext`) — the project tab's way in is `startNewLocationFromSearch()`, which sets the context itself — [Locations]
- `editLocation()` / `saveLocation()` / `deleteLocation()` — edit, persist, and delete a location record — [Locations]
- `debouncedAddressSearch()` / `runAddressSearch()` / `pickAddress()` — debounce and run address geocoding search, and select a result — [Locations]
- `updateMapPreview()` — refreshes the embedded map preview for the currently selected location coordinates — [Locations]
- `haversine()` — great-circle distance helper between two lat/lon points — [Locations, Shared/utility functions]
- `AMENITY_SEARCH` — per-kind config (OSM tag, search radii, noun, form element id) for the nearest-amenity lookups — [Locations]
- `findNearestAmenity()` — nearest hospital OR parking via the OSM Overpass API, widening through `AMENITY_SEARCH[kind].radii` until something is found — [Locations]
- `lookupAmenityForForm()` — the "Find nearest hospital / parking" buttons on the location form; stores the result on `locFormState` — [Locations]
  - REMOVED in Phase U (do not look for these): findNearestHospital, findNearestParking, lookupHospitalForForm, lookupParkingForForm — four near-identical functions now covered by the two above
- `amenityLine()` — formats a `{name, address, distanceKm}` amenity as one display line, everywhere one is shown — [Locations, Shoot Days]
- `findLocationByName()` — looks up a location record by its name — [Locations, Shared/utility functions]
- `locSelectOptionsHTML()` / `refreshLocationDropdowns()` — build and refresh `<option>` lists of locations for pickers — [Locations]

## Tech Specs (Camera Designations, shot numbering)

- `renderProjectTech()` — renders the project Tech Specs tab: project-default tech fields, shot-numbering mode, camera designations list, and (Phase P1) the Tech specs roundup, each wrapped in `techBlockHTML()` so every section on this tab is collapsible — [Tech Specs]
- `techBlocks` / `toggleTechBlock()` / `setAllTechBlocksCollapsed()` / `techBlockHTML()` (Phase P1) — collapsible-block state and rendering for the Tech tab's three sections (`defaults`, `cameras`, `roundup`), same shared plumbing (`applyBlockState`/`toggleBlock`/`setAllBlocksCollapsed`) as Preview & Export's `pv` blocks and the Shoot Day editor's `sd` blocks. `roundup` starts collapsed (`techBlocks.roundup = false`); `defaults`/`cameras` start open — matches the Hotel summary block's collapsed-by-default pattern — [Tech Specs]
- `saveProjectTechSpecs()` — persists the project-level tech spec defaults and continuous/reset numbering choice — [Tech Specs]
- `cameraDesignationRows()` (Phase P1) — flattens a normalized `cams` object into the `{letter,name,shorthand,tag}` rows used by every camera-designations table; shared by `buildFullData()` (per-day, Preview & Export) and `projectTechRoundupData()` (project-level, Tech tab) — [Tech Specs, Preview & Export]
- `techSpecsRoundupBodyHTML()` (Phase P1) — renders the tech-spec-rows table + camera-designations table shared by the Tech tab's roundup and Preview & Export's Tech specs block — [Tech Specs, Preview & Export]
- `projectTechRoundupData()` / `renderTechSpecsRoundup()` / `copyProjectTechSpecsText()` / `copyProjectTechSpecs()` (Phase P1) — the Tech tab's own "Tech specs roundup" section (T-4.4): project-defaults tech specs + project-scope camera designations, resolved without any day context (the Tech tab has no selected shoot day), with its own Copy button. Re-rendered on every tech-field/camera edit (`body.oninput` in `renderProjectTech()`, and from the non-day branch of `commitCameras()`) so it stays live without a full tab re-render — [Tech Specs]
- `jumpToTechRoundup()` (Phase P3) — the "Summary" jump-link next to the Tech tab's Expand all/Collapse all: expands `techBlocks.roundup` if collapsed, then scrolls `#techBlock-roundup` (the `techBlockHTML('roundup', …)` wrapper) into view — [Tech Specs]
- `resolveTechSpecs()` / `techSpecsOverridden()` — resolve a shoot day's effective tech specs (day override vs. project default) — [Tech Specs]
- `resetDayTechSpecs()` — clears a day's tech spec override, reverting it to the project default — [Tech Specs]
- `refreshTechSpecsBanner()` — updates the "using project default / overridden" banner shown on a shoot day — [Tech Specs]
- `TECHSPEC_FIELDS` / `TECHSPEC_DEFAULTS` / `TECHSPEC_LABELS` / `TECHSPEC_HINTS` — the tech spec keys, their default values, their human labels, and each field's placeholder + box width — [Tech Specs]
- `techSpecFieldsHTML()` — the six tech-spec inputs, rendered once for both the project defaults (prefix `pj`) and a day's override (prefix `ts`) — [Tech Specs]
- `techSpecFieldId()` / `setTechSpecFields()` / `readTechSpecFields()` — build a field's DOM id, and fill/read a whole tech-spec form — [Tech Specs]
- `techSpecRows()` — `[label, value]` pairs for the fields that have a value; shared by the Preview table, the copyable text and the Excel sheet — [Tech Specs, Preview & Export]
- `CAMERA_LETTERS` — the A–Z pool used to assign camera designation letters — [Tech Specs]
- `letterForIndex()` — maps a camera's position index to its designation letter — [Tech Specs]
- `cinematographyCrew()` — returns the crew on a project who belong to the Cinematography department — [Tech Specs]
- `normalizeCameras()` — reconciles a project's/day's camera list against current cinematography crew (adds/removes/reorders entries) — [Tech Specs]
- `resolveCameras()` / `camerasOverridden()` — resolve a shoot day's effective camera list (day override vs. project) — [Tech Specs]
- `nameInitials()` — derives initials from a crew member's name for camera tagging — [Tech Specs]
- `shortenCameraModel()` — abbreviates a camera model name by stripping known brand prefixes — [Tech Specs]
- `CAMERA_BRAND_PREFIXES` — brand name prefixes stripped by `shortenCameraModel()` — [Tech Specs]
- `cameraFileTag()` — builds the camera's file-naming tag from letter, model and operator name — [Tech Specs]
- `renderCameraDesignations()` — renders the camera designation list/editor for either the project defaults or a specific day — [Tech Specs]
- `camerasForEdit()` — returns the camera list currently being edited for a given scope (project/day) — [Tech Specs]
- `moveOperator()` / `addOperatorCamera()` / `removeOperatorCamera()` / `setOperatorCameraField()` — reorder, add, remove and edit an operator-assigned camera entry — [Tech Specs]
- `addUnnamedCamera()` / `removeUnnamedCamera()` / `setUnnamedCameraField()` / `moveUnnamedCamera()` — add, remove, edit and reorder a camera with no assigned operator — [Tech Specs]
- `commitCameras()` — the shared tail of every camera edit: persist, re-render the list, and (day scope only) refresh the overridden-vs-default banner — [Tech Specs]

## Shoot Days

- `dayTabsBarHTML()` — renders the row of day-number tabs used to switch between shoot days — [Shoot Days]
- `renderProjectDays()` — renders the Shoot Days tab body (day tabs + selected day's editor) — [Shoot Days]
- `selectShootDay()` — sets the active shoot day and re-renders the project body — [Shoot Days]
- `makeShootDayRecord()` / `STARTER_SCHEDULE` — constructs a new blank shoot day record, seeded with the starter CALL/LUNCH/WRAP schedule — [Shoot Days]
- `addShootDay()` / `deleteShootDay()` — create and remove a shoot day — [Shoot Days]
- `syncShootDayCount()` — grows the shoot day count immediately (blank new days), or (when shrinking) expands an inline checkbox picker instead of deciding for the user — [Shoot Days]
- `shootDayReductionPending` / `shootDayLabel()` / `toggleShootDayReductionPick()` / `cancelShootDayReduction()` / `confirmShootDayReduction()` / `shootDayReductionPanelHTML()` — the inline "select N days to remove" picker (Phase T item 1) shown on the Overview tab under the Shoot days count field when shrinking it, replacing the old sequence of native `prompt()` popups. Confirm is disabled until exactly the required number of days is ticked — [Shoot Days]
- `toggleShootDayBlock()` / `setAllShootDayBlocksCollapsed()` / `sdBlock()` — collapse/expand and render the shoot day editor's collapsible sub-sections — [Shoot Days]
- `shootDayBuildHTML()` — builds the full shoot day editor form markup (general info, schedule, positions, tech) — [Shoot Days]
- `projectCrewOptions()` — builds crew `<option>` list scoped to the current project, for shoot-day pickers — [Shoot Days]

- `quickAddLocationForDay()` — quick-creates a new location record directly from the shoot day form — [Shoot Days]
- `togglePosnCompany()` / `togglePosnDept()` — collapse/expand a company/department group within the position assignments list — [Shoot Days]
- `captureInProgressPositions()` — snapshots in-progress position edits before a re-render so they aren't lost — [Shoot Days]
- `renderPositionAssignments()` — renders the position (crew call time) assignment list for a shoot day, grouped by company/department, roles within a department ordered by `roleSeniorityRank()` (Phase N item 2) — [Shoot Days]
- `refreshAddPosnPick()` / `addPosnToDay()` / `removePosnRow()` — refresh the "add position" picker and add/remove a crew position on the day — [Shoot Days]
- `addSchedRow()` / `insertSchedRowBefore()` — add a new schedule row, optionally inserted before another row — [Shoot Days]
- `parseTimeStrToMins()` / `parseTimeRangeToMins()` / `parseDurationToMins()` / `formatMinsAsDuration()` / `formatMinsAsTime()` — parse and format time/duration strings for the schedule table — [Shoot Days]
- `onScheduleTimeInput()` / `onScheduleDurationInput()` — recompute dependent schedule fields as the user types times/durations — [Shoot Days]
- `moveSchedRow()` / `shiftSelected()` / `toggleSelectAllSched()` / `shiftScheduleTimes()` — reorder schedule rows and bulk-shift selected rows' times — [Shoot Days]
- `rowsOf()` — collects DOM rows matching a container/class selector, used by the schedule table logic — [Shoot Days, Shared/utility functions]
- `populateShootDay()` — fills the shoot day form fields from a day record when switching days — [Shoot Days]
- `onDayChanged()` — refreshes location/hospital/parking summaries after the selected day changes — [Shoot Days]

- `fetchWeatherForDay()` — fetches forecast weather for the day's date/location from Open-Meteo — [Shoot Days]
- `WMO` — lookup table mapping Open-Meteo weather codes to human-readable conditions — [Shoot Days]
- `saveShootDay()` — validates and persists the current shoot day's form data — [Shoot Days]

## Budget

Cost visibility only (Phase Budget) — not a working budget. Rolls up cost data already
entered elsewhere in the app rather than owning any of its own, with one exception: no
per-project hotel rate existed anywhere before this phase, so `getHotelCosts()`/
`saveHotelCosts()` were added, same `{field: Number(val)||0}` shape as
`getCateringCosts()`/`getTransportCosts()`. Deliberately excludes location fees (one
fee can span several shoot days, not handled here) and offers no editable line-item
budget or export of its own — Preview & Export stays the export surface.

- `VAT_RATE` — fixed at 0.20 (UK standard). Not project-configurable — a real rate
  input is out of scope for a cost-visibility phase — [Budget]
- `parseRateNumber()` — best-effort numeric extraction from the crew database's
  free-text Fee/rate field ("£450/day" → 450); returns `null` (not 0) when nothing
  numeric is found, so "no rate on file" stays distinguishable from "costs nothing" —
  [Budget]
- `resolveCrewRate()` — **the per-project day-rate override mechanism.** Day rate
  needs to vary by job, so it follows the same shape as every other per-project
  per-crew-id map already in the app (`p.travelMethods`, `p.hotelNightBefore`,
  `day.crewOverrides`): `p.crewRateOverrides[crewId]`. Checked first; falls back to
  `parseRateNumber(c.rate)`; falls back to "no rate on file" (`hasRate:false`) rather
  than silently costing someone at 0 — [Budget]
- `saveCrewRateOverride()` — writes/clears one person's override (empty input clears
  it, reverting to the database rate); rejects a non-numeric entry by re-rendering
  without saving, so the field visibly reverts instead of holding invalid text —
  edited inline on the Per Person view, no separate edit affordance (matches the
  Phase Detail "Show as" decision — a plain input, not a pencil-and-save control) —
  [Budget]
- `getHotelCosts()` / `saveHotelCosts()` — the one cost rate Budget owns itself
  (`p.hotelCosts.perRoomNight`), since Catering/Travel already have theirs on their
  own tabs — [Budget]
- `budgetView` / `setBudgetView()` — which of the three views (`department` /
  `person` / `day`) is showing, same pattern as `crewGridView` — [Budget]
- `budgetVatToggle` / `toggleBudgetVat()` — itemized (every figure ex-VAT, VAT broken
  out as its own line in the summary bar) vs baked in (VAT folded silently into every
  figure everywhere, one Total). Extras (catering/travel/hotel) never carry VAT in
  either state — only a crew member's own rate does, gated on `c.vatRegistered` —
  [Budget]
- `budgetPersonDisplay()` — the one function that applies the VAT toggle to a
  person's cost; every rollup (department, day, person-view Subtotal) is built by
  summing this, not the raw subtotal, so the toggle can never go stale in one view
  and not another — [Budget]
- `budgetDayBlocks` / `syncBudgetDayBlocks()` / `toggleBudgetDayBlock()` /
  `setAllBudgetDayBlocksCollapsed()` / `toggleAllBudgetDayBlocks()` — Per Day's
  collapsible rows, same shared plumbing (`toggleBlock`/`setAllBlocksCollapsed`/
  `applyBlockState`, prefix `bd`) as the `sd`/`tt`/`pv` blocks. Unlike those, this
  state is keyed by shoot-day id rather than a small fixed set of section names, so
  `syncBudgetDayBlocks()` must run before every use to add/prune keys for the
  project's current days — `setAllBlocksCollapsed`/`allBlocksCollapsed` only ever see
  `Object.keys(state)`, so a day that was never individually toggled would otherwise
  be silently skipped by Expand/Collapse-all — [Budget]
- `buildBudgetData()` — the one aggregator behind all three views and the summary
  bar. Days worked = shoot days where `(d.positions||[]).some(pos=>pos[0]===crewId)`,
  the same on-day signal `buildTransportSummary()`/Days-on-site already use. Hotel
  room-nights are counted directly off `d.hotelNights`/`p.hotelNightBefore` rather
  than via `buildHotelSummary()`, which filters to "active" nights only and would
  need label-matching to recover one specific day's figure — this way project-wide
  and per-day hotel costs share one calculation. The night before Day 1 has no
  shoot-day row of its own, so its rooms fold into Day 1. Department rollups (both
  project-wide and per-day) are filtered by **presence** (someone's actually in that
  department), not by a truthy total — a department with people but no rate set
  shows as £0.00 rather than vanishing, which is the whole point of a cost-visibility
  screen — [Budget]
- `budgetSummaryBarHTML()` — the three-line/one-line summary bar, driven by
  `budgetVatToggle` — [Budget]
- `budgetDeptExtrasTableHTML()` — the department-rows + Catering/Travel/Hotels
  extras + Total table, shared verbatim by the project-wide Per Department view and
  each Per Day row's own expanded breakdown ("same structure … just scoped to that
  single day" per the brief) — [Budget]
- `budgetDepartmentViewHTML()` / `budgetPersonViewHTML()` / `budgetDayViewHTML()` —
  the three views. Per Person's row order is canonical department order then
  `sortHoDFirst()` within it — there's no existing sortable-table (click-a-column)
  pattern anywhere in this app to extend, so this is a fixed, sensible order rather
  than a new UI paradigm built for one screen — [Budget]

## Preview & Export

- `togglePreviewBlock()` / `setAllPreviewBlocksCollapsed()` / `pvBlockHTML()` — collapse/expand and render the Preview tab's collapsible export blocks — [Preview & Export]
- `exportFormat` / `exportSections` / `EXPORT_SECTION_LABELS` / `setExportFormat()` / `toggleExportSection()` (Phase Q) — **the two independent export choices.** `exportFormat` ('printable' | 'whatsapp') picks the output SHAPE; `exportSections` ({tech, catering, hotels, travel}, all true by default) picks WHICH optional content areas that shape carries. Session state, not persisted — same rule as `previewBlocks`/`crewGridView`: this is "what am I sending right now", not a project property. Excel is deliberately **not** a third format — see the Phase Q section at the bottom of this file — [Preview & Export]
- `exportPanelOpen` / `toggleExportPanel()` / `exportHiddenSectionCount()` / `exportOptionsHTML()` / `exportPanelHTML()` (Phase Q follow-up) — **the Format panel, built in the Crew tab's Filter idiom**: a `crewToolbarHTML()` row carrying one `.crew-header-filter` toggle (caret + "Format: Printable/WhatsApp" + "(N sections hidden)" when any are unticked), with a `.filter-panel` rendered BELOW the row, never inside it — a full-width panel in a flex row distorts its alignment every time it opens, the same note `projectCrewFilterPanelHTML()` carries. Include uses plain `.filter-chips` labels, so it inherits the Crew filter's chip styling instead of a bespoke rule set. The panel holds both output actions (Copy, Download .xlsx) and so starts **open**, unlike the Crew Filter — [Preview & Export]
- `exportOutputText()` / `copyExportOutput()` (Phase Q follow-up) — the single Copy path for the whole tab, replacing the old per-block `copyWA()`. Built from data via `buildWAText(buildFullData(d))`, **not** scraped off the preview card: a collapsed block is `display:none` and `innerText` silently skips it, so a DOM-scraped copy would quietly depend on which blocks happened to be open. Both formats copy the same plain-text call sheet honouring the Include checkboxes; only the button label differs ("Copy for WhatsApp" / "Copy as text") — [Preview & Export]
  - REMOVED in the Phase Q follow-up (do not look for it): `copyWA()` — the WhatsApp block's own Copy button, now redundant with the panel's
- `renderProjectPreview()` — renders the Preview & Export tab body for the current `exportFormat`: printable = call sheet card + the ticked section blocks + Excel; WhatsApp = the text block alone (the sections are inside the text). Only one shape is in the DOM at a time, so `generatePreview()`/`renderPreviewCard()` both guard for a missing element rather than assuming it. Also wires the Travel block's cost-field autosave, scoped by target id — a bare `body.oninput` would fire on the Include checkboxes too, and `saveTransportCosts()` reading fields no longer in the DOM would write both rates back as 0 — [Preview & Export]
- `buildFullData()` — assembles the complete RESOLVED data set for a shoot day (crew, locations, schedule, tech specs, weather) used by every export. Each position's `role` is `c.showAs||c.role` — the one place a crew member's "Show as" cosmetic override (Phase R item 3) actually reaches the call sheet/WhatsApp text/Excel output; `canonicalRole` (`c.role`, un-cosmeticised) rides alongside it purely so seniority ranking can look the role up in `ROLES_BY_DEPT`/`ROLE_SENIORITY`, since a free-text "Show as" usually won't match a saved role name. Splits the day's positions three ways (Phase N item 3): `positions` (crew, canonical department order, Client/Talent excluded), `clientPositions`, `talentPositions` — Client and Talent stand apart from the crew departments in every output instead of sorting in among them. `coProductionGroups` (by company) is untouched by that split. Returns `positions`/`clientPositions`/`talentPositions`/each `coProductionGroups[].people` all pre-sorted by `positionOutputCompare()` — [Preview & Export, Shared/utility functions]
  - tech specs go through `resolveTechSpecs()`, NOT the raw `day.techSpecs`: a day stores only what DIFFERS from the project defaults (`saveShootDay` deletes the key when nothing differs), so reading it raw exported blank tech specs for every day sitting on the defaults — fixed in Phase U
- `positionOutputCompare()` — the shared sort for every position list in the call sheet output: department (canonical order) → role seniority within it (`roleSeniorityRank()`, via `canonicalRole`) → role text → name — [Preview & Export]
- `generatePreview()` — regenerates and re-renders all preview/export blocks for the selected day — [Preview & Export]
- `renderTechSpecsSection()` / `copyTechSpecsText()` / `copyTechSpecs()` — render and copy the tech specs reference block, day-resolved (`resolveTechSpecs`/`resolveCameras` via `buildFullData`). Table markup comes from the shared `techSpecsRoundupBodyHTML()`/`cameraDesignationRows()` (Phase P1), also used by the Tech tab's project-level `renderTechSpecsRoundup()` (T-4.4) — [Preview & Export, Tech Specs]
- `renderPreviewCard()` / `positionsTableHTML()` — render the formatted call sheet preview card; `positionsTableHTML()` is the shared Dept/Position/Name/Call/Phone table markup behind the Client block (before Position assignments), the crew Position assignments block, the Talent block (after it), and each co-production group (Phase N item 3) — [Preview & Export]
- `buildWAText()` / `pushPeopleLines()` — build the WhatsApp-formatted plain-text call sheet (copying is `copyExportOutput()`'s job now); `pushPeopleLines()` is the shared "*HEADING*" + per-person lines block behind CLIENT/POSITIONS/TALENT/each co-production group, same ordering as the preview card (Phase N item 3) — [Preview & Export]
- `downloadExcel()` / `pushPeopleRows()` — build and download the multi-sheet Excel call sheet (via SheetJS); `pushPeopleRows()` is the shared heading-row + table-row block behind CLIENT/POSITION ASSIGNMENTS/TALENT/each co-production group in the Call Sheet aoa, same ordering as the other two outputs (Phase N item 3). Since Phase Q it emits one sheet per **ticked** section (Tech Specs / Hotel / Catering / Travel) on top of the always-present Call Sheet — a section with no data produces no sheet whether ticked or not, since an empty tab is worse than a missing one — [Preview & Export]
- `techSpecsLines()` / `hotelSummaryLines()` / `cateringOrderLines()` / `transportSummaryLines()` (Phase Q) — the four sections as arrays of text lines, each returning `null` when there's nothing to say. Extracted from the bodies of the four Copy buttons so the WhatsApp export appends **exactly** the text those buttons produce rather than a second rendering of the same data. `techSpecsLines()` takes resolved `buildFullData()` output, not a raw day, so it can't reintroduce the raw-`day.techSpecs` bug Phase U fixed — [Preview & Export]

## Shared/utility functions

- `sb` (Supabase client) — the shared Supabase client instance used by every DB read/write — [Shared/utility functions]
- `loadDB()` / `saveDB()` — the single choke point for reading/writing any app data collection to/from Supabase, keyed by a `db:*` string — [Shared/utility functions]
- `initApp()` — bootstraps the app: loads all DB collections into memory and does the first render — [Shared/utility functions]
- `uid()` — generates a short random unique id — [Shared/utility functions]
- `esc()` — HTML-escapes a string for safe interpolation into templates — [Shared/utility functions]
- `val()` / `setv()` — get/set the trimmed value of a form input by element id — [Shared/utility functions]
- `icon()` / `ICONS` — look up and wrap an inline SVG icon by name — [Shared/utility functions]
- `flashStatus()` — the discreet "Saved" status flash shared by every save button and autosave — [Shared/utility functions]
- `copyText()` — the single clipboard path for every Copy button: async API with a textarea fallback, optional confirm message — [Shared/utility functions]
- `deptHeaderHTML()` — the one canonical collapsible group header (caret + optional code + label + count), shared by the project Crew tab, the crew database and Position Assignments — [Shared/utility functions]
- `expandCollapseAllHTML()` — the "Expand all · Collapse all" strip. Takes an optional third `extraLinkHTML` arg appended after Collapse all (Phase P3 uses this on the Tech tab for the "Summary" jump-link) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `applyBlockState()` / `toggleBlock()` / `setAllBlocksCollapsed()` — collapsible-block plumbing shared by Preview & Export (`pv` prefix) and the Shoot Day editor (`sd` prefix) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `refreshTabScrollCues()` — wraps any horizontally-overflowing `.tabs` strip so it shows an edge-fade scroll cue, and clears the cue at the end of the scroll (mobile) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `GRID_ROW_SELECTOR` / `checkboxesIn()` — the row selector and per-row day/meal checkbox list used by the grid keyboard navigation handler. `checkboxesIn` is scoped to `.crewgrid-check` so the row's bulk-select checkbox is excluded — [Shared/utility functions]
- `sortHoDFirst()` — sorts a crew list with Heads of Department first, then by name — [Shared/utility functions]
- `scheduleAutosave()` — debounces a save callback per key so rapid edits coalesce into one autosave — [Shared/utility functions]
- `DEPARTMENTS` / `DEPARTMENT_CODES` — canonical department list and their short codes used across Crew/Tech/exports — [Shared/utility functions]
- `deptBucketKey()` / `deptRank()` — normalize a crew member's department to a known bucket and rank it for sort order — [Shared/utility functions]
- `subDeptsFor()` / `SUBDEPARTMENTS_BY_DEPT` — look up the allowed sub-departments for a department — [Shared/utility functions]
- `ROLES_BY_DEPT` / `rolesFor()` — canonical role list per department; each entry declaratively belongs to a department (Phase R item 1) — a saved role IS a department, there's no separate mapping to keep in sync — [Shared/utility functions]
- `ROLE_SENIORITY` / `roleSeniorityRank()` / `moveRoleSeniority()` — per-role seniority rank within a department (Phase N item 2, e.g. DOP outranks 1st AC outranks Camera Operator), keyed by "Department/Role" path, persisted to `db:roleseniority`. Falls back to the role's position in `ROLES_BY_DEPT[dept]` when no explicit rank is set, so canonical roles sort sensibly with zero admin action; unmatched/custom-typed roles rank last. `moveRoleSeniority()` swaps a role up/down and renumbers its department densely (0,10,20…); edited via the "Role seniority order" reorder list in `renderDeptAdminPanel()` — [Shared/utility functions]
- `departmentForRolePath()` — extracts the department from a "Department/Role" saved-role path string; the one place department is ever read off a role — [Shared/utility functions]
- `rolesTagListHTML()` / `roleAddPickerHTML()` / `addRoleToCrew()` / `removeRoleFromCrew()` / `setActiveRole()` — render and manage a crew member's multiple assignable roles. `setActiveRole()` is the sole place a crew member's `department`/`subDepartment` are ever set — always derived from whichever saved role just became active, never typed directly. `removeRoleFromCrew()` refuses to remove a person's last remaining role, and re-activates a replacement if the removed one was active — [Shared/utility functions]
- `pendingNewCrewRole` / `newCrewRolePickerHTML()` / `onNewCrewRolePick()` — single-role picker for a brand-new, not-yet-saved crew member (no id yet to attach a saved role to) — stashed here until `saveCrew()` creates the record with it — [Shared/utility functions]
- `addRoleDialogFor` / `openAddRoleDialog()` / `closeAddRoleDialog()` / `addRoleDialogHTML()` / `confirmAddRoleDialog()` / `renderGlobalOverlay()` — the "Add new role" dialog (Phase R item 5): one in-page dialog (Department select + Role name) rendered into the persistent `#globalOverlay` div outside `#main`, replacing the old two-`prompt()` flow. Adds straight onto a crew id, or (when opened as `'__new__'`) feeds `pendingNewCrewRole` for the not-yet-saved crew form — [Shared/utility functions]
- `duplicateCrew()` — clones a crew record as a starting point for a new one — [Shared/utility functions]
- `coProPillSelect()` / `quickSetCoPro()` / `coProCompaniesList` — render and update a crew member's co-production company assignment — [Shared/utility functions]
- `crewIdentityHTML()` / `deptLabelHTML()` / `posnIdentityHTML()` / `crewExpansionHTML()` — shared rendering helpers for how a crew member's identity/role/department are displayed across tabs. `crewIdentityHTML()`'s department badge is always the read-only `deptLabelHTML()` now (no more editable department pill — see Phase R item 1). `opts.hideDept` / `opts.hideLeadPill` suppress the department badge / Lead Company pill (used by Days on site/Hotel/Travel/Catering — Phase S item 6; the Roles tab doesn't use this function at all any more, see `crewRolesRowHTML`). `opts.showAsOrRole` displays `c.showAs||c.role` instead of the raw role (Phase S item 8 — those same four tabs are display-only for role, editing only ever happens on the Roles tab) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `appSettings` / `SETTINGS_DEFAULTS` / `HEADER_FONTS` / `TINT_ALPHAS` / `hexToRgbTriple()` / `applyAppSettings()` / `setSetting()` / `previewSetting()` / `saveAppSettings()` / `resetAppSettings()` (Phase Q) — the app's configurable header font and brand colours, persisted to `db:settings` (an object key, so it's in `loadDB`'s `isObjKey` list alongside `db:subdepartments`/`db:roleseniority`). `applyAppSettings()` works by writing the SAME custom properties the stylesheet already declares in `:root` — `--disp`, `--tape`, `--tape-light` and all six `--tint-N`, the last derived from the brand hex — onto `documentElement`, so no CSS rule needs to know settings exist. `previewSetting()` applies without saving: the colour picker fires `oninput` continuously while dragging, and one Supabase write per hue is not a trade worth making — `onchange` calls `setSetting()` to persist. Only families already in the Google Fonts `<link>` (plus two system stacks) may be added to `HEADER_FONTS` — [Shared/utility functions]
- `renderSettings()` / `goSettings()` (Phase Q) — the Settings screen (S-1), reached from the sidebar. A full screen, not a floating cog panel: the app's one existing pattern for a project-independent thing you go and look at is the sidebar screen (Crew database, Locations database), and a modal would have been a second pattern for no gain — [Shared/utility functions]
- `renderSide()` — renders the left sidebar (project list, nav) — [Shared/utility functions]
- `toggleDrawer()` / `closeDrawer()` — open/close the mobile navigation drawer — [Shared/utility functions]
- `setTopbarTitle()` — updates the mobile top bar's title text — [Shared/utility functions]
- `goDatabase()` / `goNewProject()` / `openProject()` / `goProjectTab()` — top-level router functions that change `route`/`currentProjectId`/`currentProjectTab` and re-render — [Shared/utility functions]
- `renderMain()` — dispatches the main panel render based on the current route — [Shared/utility functions]
- `projCode()` — derives a project's short display code — [Shared/utility functions]
- `fmtDate()` — formats an ISO date string as a human-readable date — [Shared/utility functions]
- `renderCrewDatabase()` / `renderCrewList()` / `crewSearchBlob()` / `crewCardHTML()` — render the standalone crew database screen, its filtered list, and its search index/card markup. `crewSearchBlob()` includes `c.showAs` so the cosmetic override is searchable too — [Crew, Shared/utility functions]
- `toggleDeptCollapse()` / `setAllDeptsCollapsed()` — collapse/expand department groups in the crew database list — [Crew]
- `toggleProjectDeptCollapse()` / `setAllProjectDeptsCollapsed()` — the same, for the project Crew tab's groups — [Crew]
- `crewFormHTML()` / `toggleCarFields()` — render the add/edit crew form and react to "has car" toggling. No more free-text Role or manual Department field (Phase R item 1/follow-up): existing crew (`c.id` set) get the live saved-roles tag-list editor; a brand-new crew member gets `newCrewRolePickerHTML()` instead, required to save. Also has the new "Show as" text field — [Crew]
- `refreshCrewScreen()` / `toggleCrewForm()` / `closeCrewForm()` / `editCrew()` / `toggleCrewView()` / `crewViewHTML()` — manage opening/closing/viewing the crew form and read-only crew detail view. `toggleCrewForm()`/`closeCrewForm()` reset `pendingNewCrewRole` when the new-crew form opens/closes — [Crew]
- `saveCrew()` — persist a crew record. Refuses to create a brand-new crew member without `pendingNewCrewRole` set ("every crew member needs at least one saved role"); for a new record, role/department/`roles` are derived entirely from that pick. For an existing record, role/department/`roles` are left untouched (they're managed live by `addRoleToCrew`/`setActiveRole` elsewhere, not by this form) — [Crew]
- `deleteCrew()` — delete a crew record — [Crew]
- `renderDeptAdminPanel()` / `toggleDeptAdminPanel()` — collapsible "Departments & sub-departments" panel on the Crew database screen: one block per department showing its sub-departments (add/rename/remove), its "Role seniority order" reorder list (Phase N item 2 — up/down via `moveRoleSeniority()`), and its roster, Heads of Department pinned to the top — [Crew]
- `addSubDeptAdmin()` / `renameSubDeptAdmin()` / `removeSubDeptAdmin()` — add, rename (updates any crew already on it) and remove (clears it off any crew) a sub-department from the admin panel — [Crew]
- `toggleHoD()` — toggles a crew member's `isHoD` flag (Head of Department), used to pin them to the top of their department's roster in the admin panel and, via `crewRolesRowHTML`/roster sorts, elsewhere — [Crew]
- `crewDbFilter` / `crewDbFilterOpen` / `crewSearchQuery` — Crew database's filter-panel state (same shape as `projectCrewFilter`, no group-by since there's no hotel context) and the free-text search, kept outside the DOM so re-renders don't clear the search box — [Crew]
- `personMatchesCrewDbFilter()` / `sortCrewDbGroup()` / `toggleCrewDbFilterPanel()` / `toggleCrewDbFilterDept()` / `toggleCrewDbFilterRole()` / `setCrewDbFilterField()` / `toggleCrewDbFilterFlag()` / `clearCrewDbFilter()` / `crewDbActiveFilterCount()` / `crewDbFilterPanelHTML()` — Crew database's filter panel (multiselect departments, lead company, roles, exclude-Talent/exclude-other-companies, sort) — [Crew]

# Section codes

Short handles for the app's tabs, sections and tools, so a request can name a screen
instead of describing it ("tighten up T-2.2" rather than "the days-on-site checkbox
grid on the Crew tab"). A convenience aid, not something every request has to use.
It pairs with the function map above: MAP.md codes the *code*, this codes the *UI*.

The `T-` numbers follow the tab order left to right, which is also the working order —
coarse information first, finest detail last.

| T-4.2 | · Shot numbering | Continuous vs reset-each-day | `saveProjectTechSpecs()` |
| T-4.3 | · Camera designations (project) | Operator order → letters; unmanned cameras | `renderCameraDesignations('project')` |
| T-4.4 | · Tech specs roundup | Collapsed-by-default summary (rows + camera designations table) of the project defaults, with its own Copy button — same table markup as T-6.3, which keeps its own copy of this block (Phase P1) | `renderTechSpecsRoundup()` |
| **T-5** | **Shoot Days** | The per-day detail | `renderProjectDays()` |
| T-5.1 | · Day tabs | Day switcher + New day | `dayTabsBarHTML()` |
| T-5.2 | · General information | Day #/date/call, brief, parking, notes, locations, weather, hospital, parking lookup — one bound card, `.subhead`-divided (Phase N item 1), matching T-1.1 | `sdBlock('general', …)` |
| T-5.3 | · Schedule | Time/duration rows, insert, reorder, bulk time shift | `addSchedRow()` / `shiftScheduleTimes()` |

| T-6.3 | · Per Person | Flat list — Name, Role, editable Day rate (per-project override), Days worked, Subtotal | `budgetPersonViewHTML()` |
| T-6.4 | · Per Day | One collapsed row per shoot day (day number + short location label + total), expanding to that day's own department + extras breakdown | `budgetDayViewHTML()` |
| **T-7** | **Preview & Export** | The finest-detail choices and the outputs | `renderProjectPreview()` |
| T-7.0 | · Format panel | Collapsible Filter-style panel: Printable/WhatsApp selector, the four section checkboxes that gate all three outputs, and both output actions (Copy, Download .xlsx) | `exportPanelHTML()` |
| T-7.1 | · Call sheet preview | Formatted card — Client block, then crew Position assignments, then Talent block, then co-production groups (Phase N item 3) | `renderPreviewCard()` |
| T-7.2 | · WhatsApp text | Plain-text version for the full crew (no tech specs) — same Client/Positions/Talent/co-production ordering as T-7.1 | `buildWAText()` |
| T-7.2b | · Hotel summary | Same room-booking table + per-night table as T-2.3's Hotel summary, shown again here below the WhatsApp text | `hotelSummaryHTML()` |
| T-7.3 | · Tech specs | Camera/technical crew reference + camera designations, per the selected shoot day (resolved override vs. project default). Kept here as-is even after Phase P1 added the project-level version at T-4.4 — this one stays day-aware, T-4.4 doesn't | `renderTechSpecsSection()` |
| T-7.4 | · Transport summary | Same cost fields + per-day method-count grid as T-2.4, shown here too when Travel is ticked (Phase Q) | `transportSummaryHTML()` |
| T-7.5 | · Catering order | Per-day headcounts + dietary requirements | `renderCateringExport()` |
| T-7.6 | · Excel export | Multi-sheet .xlsx — Call Sheet plus one sheet per ticked section (Phase Q) — same Client/Positions/Talent/co-production ordering as T-7.1. No longer a block of its own: it's the Download .xlsx button in T-7.0 | `downloadExcel()` |

## D — Databases (project-independent, the source of truth)

| Code | Section | What it is | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D-1** | **Crew database** | Every crew member, searchable, grouped by department | `renderCrewDatabase()` |
| D-1.1 | · Departments & sub-departments | Admin panel: structure + Heads of Department | `renderDeptAdminPanel()` |
| D-1.2 | · Filter panel | Departments, roles, lead company, exclusions, sort | `crewDbFilterPanelHTML()` |

| D-2.2 | · Nearest hospital / parking | OpenStreetMap Overpass lookup, saved onto the location | `lookupAmenityForForm()` |

## S — Settings

| Code | Section | What it is | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S-1** | **Settings** | App-wide font and brand colour, reached from the sidebar | `renderSettings()` |

## Style audit — pattern names (Phase Style Review)

`style-audit.html` is a standalone interactive decision tool at the repo root (not
linked from `index.html`'s nav — open it directly). It copies the app's real CSS
verbatim from `index.html` so every example is styled by the app's actual rules, not
a re-implementation. For each flagged inconsistency (heading styles, eyebrow labels,
box styles, dividers, expand/collapse patterns, dead icons, etc.) it lets you
click-to-pick a preferred option and/or add a notes field, then an "Export all
decisions" button (`exportDecisions()`) compiles the picks/notes into a single block
of text to paste back for follow-up phases. Sections: Typography, Colors, Spacing,
Component behaviors, Icons (existing), Icons (candidates). Purely diagnostic — makes
no changes to `index.html` or app styling itself.

## Fonts & Icons review page (Phase Fonts)

`style-audit-fonts.html` — second review page, same click-to-pick + notes + "Export all
decisions" system as `style-audit.html`, also standalone at the repo root and not
linked from `index.html`. Copies the app's CSS and its `ICONS` object verbatim so every
example and every icon is the real thing. Eleven sections: font families, size ladder,
weights vs what's actually loaded, sizing/alignment, input boxes & dropdowns,
checkboxes, general section rules, dividing lines, the Crew "All" controls, icons, and
secondary colour. 18 decisions.

The dividing-lines section counts only **lines drawn on to divide** — a rule added
under each item in a list that is already grouped. It deliberately excludes the row
structure of things that genuinely function as a table, column-header rules, the
reorderable schedule rows, and form-control borders; the user drew that distinction
explicitly and it changes the conclusion. Measured on the ROW 2026 sample project
(66 crew, 11 departments, 6 days):

| Screen | Drawn dividers | Heading rules |
|---|---|---|
| Overview | 0 | 2 |
| Preview & Export | 0 | 8 |
| Shoot Days | 8 (`.cam-row`) | 21 |
| Tech | 8 (`.cam-row`) | 4 |
| Crew — Roles | 55 (`.roles-grid-row`) | 13 |
| Crew — Days on site | 55 (`.crewgrid-row`) | 13 |
| Crew — Catering | 121 | 14 |

So drawn-on dividers are almost entirely a **Crew tab** problem. Preview & Export draws
none — its 165 lines are all real table structure on a document that gets printed.
Shoot Days reads well because it runs 21 heading rules against 8 drawn lines; Crew
inverts that ratio and repeats grouping the department heading already states.
Catering doubles up: each person gets a `.crewgrid-catering-person` rule *and* sits
inside `.crewgrid-row`. Re-measure rather than assuming these numbers still hold.

Two defects it documents, both checkable against the font request on line 8 of
`index.html`:
- **Fraunces 500 is loaded but never used** — every `--disp` rule renders at 700.
- **Jost 700 is used but not loaded** — `.dept-code` and the mobile checkbox tick ask
  for it, so the browser synthesises a fake bold. Jost is requested at 400/500/600.

## The decisions (Phase Q)

**Format and Include are two questions, not one list.** *Format* is the SHAPE of the
output — a formatted call sheet you print, or plain text you paste into a chat.
*Include* is WHICH of the four optional content areas that shape carries. Rolling
them into one list of five options would have forced a choice between "WhatsApp" and
"WhatsApp with hotels", which is not a choice anybody has.

**The Format panel is the Filter component, reused.** Same construction as the Crew
tab's Filter: a `.crew-header-filter` toggle in a `crewToolbarHTML()` row, with the
`.filter-panel` below the row rather than inside it, and Include rendered as plain
`.filter-chips` labels so it inherits the chip styling instead of a bespoke rule set
(the first cut had its own `.export-include*` rules — those are gone). The toggle
summarises state the way the Filter's `(N)` count does: current format, plus
"(N sections hidden)" when any are unticked.
⚠️ It starts **open**, unlike the Crew Filter. It holds the tab's two output ACTIONS,
and hiding the button you came to press behind a caret is the same mistake
`pvBlockHTML()` already avoids by keeping Copy buttons visible in collapsed headers.

**One Copy button for the whole tab.** The WhatsApp block's own Copy moved into the
panel and `copyWA()` is gone — two buttons doing one job is how things drift.
`exportOutputText()` builds from data rather than scraping the preview card, because
a collapsed block is `display:none` and `innerText` skips it: a DOM-scraped copy
would quietly depend on which blocks happened to be open. Both formats copy the same
plain-text call sheet honouring the Include checkboxes; only the label differs.

**Excel is not a third format.** It is the printable content in a spreadsheet
container: same call sheet, same sections, same order, just a different file to hand
to an accountant or a caterer. So it's a download button in the Format panel rather
than a third radio option, and it obeys the same four checkboxes — one sheet per
ticked section on top of the always-present Call Sheet. A section with no
data produces no sheet whether ticked or not; an empty tab is worse than a missing
one. If Excel ever needs a genuinely different content shape it earns a third format
then, not before.

**Tech specs is now a checkbox, not a hardcode.** The WhatsApp text used to exclude
tech specs unconditionally, explained only by a hint under the box ("the version for
the full crew"). That rule is now the Tech specs checkbox, so the crew-wide message
is one untick away and the choice is visible. Hotels, Catering and Travel are
appended to the text the same way — each is exactly the text its own Copy button
produces, via the shared `*Lines()` builders, so the two can't drift.

**Settings is a sidebar screen, not a cog panel.** The app has one existing pattern
for a project-independent thing you go and look at, and it's the sidebar screen
(Crew database, Locations database). A floating cog panel would have been a second
pattern for no gain.

**Settings works entirely through tokens the stylesheet already had.**
`applyAppSettings()` writes `--disp`, `--tape`, `--tape-light` and the six `--tint-N`
onto `documentElement`; no CSS rule knows settings exist. That only works if every
brand-coloured surface actually reads a token, which is why the two "deliberate
one-offs" the Style Review left inline — the sidebar active gradient and the
selected-role/HoD pill — became `--tint-5` and `--tint-6`. A token that isn't a
token can't follow the brand colour.
⚠️ Only add a family to `HEADER_FONTS` if it's in the Google Fonts `<link>` on line 8
(or a system stack). Anything else silently renders as the fallback.

**No multi-tenancy.** Single hardcoded `COMPANY`, shown read-only on the Settings
screen. Per-company logo and detail upload is explicitly parked until the app is used
by someone outside Little Film Productions — only font and colour are configurable.

**One way to add a location.** The Locations tab used to carry two buttons that
overlapped: a database dropdown and a separate "add a new location" form. Which one
you needed depended on something you could only learn by opening the dropdown and
reading it, and picking wrong meant backing out and starting again in the other. Now
one button opens a search field, and "create new location" is the last row of the
same result list, prefilled with what you typed — so the answer to "is it already
saved?" arrives as you type and either outcome continues from where you already are.
Both paths still end where they always did (`addLocToProject()` / `saveLocation()`
with `locFormContext` set). The Shoot Day form's `quickAddLocationForDay()` is a
different entry point on a different screen and was left alone.

## The design system, as decided (Phase Detail)

Applied from the `style-audit-detail.html` decisions. Supersedes the Phase Fonts
section where they disagree.

**The Crew toolbar is one component.** `crewToolbarHTML()` and
`crewToolbarSelectAll()` own the bar's markup and ordering — build it there, never
inline. It previously existed only as four loose string variables concatenated inside
`renderProjectCrew()`, which is exactly how its four controls drifted into four
different fonts and shapes. Order is **Select all / Filter … Summary /
Expand-Collapse all**: left is what you act *with*, right is what you act on the whole
list *with*, and the All-type action sits furthest right above the grid's own All
column. No rule under the bar.

⚠️ **`.crew-header-row label` must stay.** Select all is a `<label>`, so the global
`label{font-family:var(--label)}` rule was giving it Oswald 11px while its neighbours
were Jost 12px — the visible reason the bar looked unrelated. That override puts it
back in the toolbar's font. Remove it and the bug returns.

**Company headings are Oswald 700, ink, uppercase.** `.posn-company-header` was
Fraunces 700 15px green, identical to `.sd-block-head` directly above it, so Position
assignments stacked two indistinguishable heading levels. Now block (Fraunces green) /
company (Oswald bold ink) / department (Oswald 11px green) read as three distinct
levels. **Oswald 700 was added to the font request** for this.

**Preview & Export has no rule between people.** `.card td` carries no border;
`.card th` alone carries a 1.5px 35% rule under the column headings. The card stays
white. Phase Fonts kept the per-row borders by reading that table as functional
structure — that was wrong, and this reverses it.

**Short fields use the Tech Specs pattern.** Shoot Days' Day details and Weather rows
are `.ts-grid`/`.ts-field`, not `.grid.g4`. Width classes `fld-xs` 52px / `fld-sm`
78px / `fld-md` 132px / `fld-date` 150px size each box to the value it holds. Long
fields — brief, parking, notes — stay full-width stacked.

**"Show as" is just an input.** No pencil, no edit state, no save button; the
`quickEditShowAsId` flag is gone. `saveQuickShowAs(id, value)` fires on `onchange`,
so it writes only when the value actually changed and focus has left — tabbing through
66 rows saves nothing. It deliberately does **not** re-render, which would steal focus
from wherever you tabbed to next.

**Expand/Collapse-all must decide direction at click time.** `expandCollapseAllHTML()`
takes an `onclickExpr` that calls a *toggle* (`toggleAllShootDayBlocks()`,
`toggleAllTechBlocks()`, `toggleAllPreviewBlocks()`, `toggleAllCrewDbDepts(csv)`) —
never a setter with `true`/`false` baked in. Blocks collapse via direct DOM updates
in `applyBlockState()` rather than a re-render, so anything baked into that markup
goes stale immediately: the control kept saying "Collapse all" *and* kept passing
`true`, so a second click did nothing until another action re-rendered the page.
`toggleBlock()` and `setAllBlocksCollapsed()` both call
`refreshExpandCollapseAll(prefix, …)` to keep the label honest, which also covers
collapsing every block one at a time. Affected Shoot Days (`sd`), Tech (`tt`) and
Preview & Export (`pv`); the Crew database toggle was already correct because
`setAllDeptsCollapsed()` re-renders.

**The crew grid name column is capped.** `minmax(200px,340px)` with a trailing
`minmax(0,1fr)` so spare width lands after the row. It was `minmax(200px,1fr)`, which
swallowed everything — 342px at seven day-columns but **562px at two**, stranding the
checkboxes at the right edge on short projects. 340px is what a six-day project
already gave it, so wide projects are unchanged.

## Detail review page (Phase Detail)

`style-audit-detail.html` — third review page, same click-to-pick + notes + export
system, standalone at the repo root, not linked from `index.html`. Six sections, 7
decisions: the Crew toolbar, short fields on Shoot Days, lines in Preview & Export,
company headings in Position assignments, the Roles "Show as" cell, and checkbox
column alignment.

Measurements it records, all taken from the live app:
- The Crew header row is `justify-content:space-between`, leaving **481px of empty
  space** at a 1000px viewport between Select all/Filter and Collapse all/Summary,
  growing with the window. Its four controls are four different constructions
  (`<label>`+checkbox, `<span>`+caret, bare `<span>` ×2), assembled inline in
  `renderProjectCrew()` as four separate string variables — nothing owns "the toolbar".
- The Preview & Export call sheet card carries **58 `td` bottom borders**, one under
  every person in Position assignments. `.card td, .card th` has had that rule since
  before any of these phases — it was not added, but Phase Fonts deliberately kept it
  and that was wrong.
- `.crewgrid` uses `minmax(200px,1fr)` for the name column, so it absorbs all slack:
  **342px wide at 7 day-columns, 562px at 2**, stranding the checkboxes at the right
  edge on projects with few days.
- `.posn-company-header` and `.sd-block-head` are typographically identical (Fraunces
  700 15px green), so Position assignments stacks two indistinguishable heading levels.

## The design system, as decided (Phase Fonts)

Applied from the `style-audit-fonts.html` decisions. **Where this contradicts the
Phase Style Review section below, this wins** — several things were deliberately
reversed. The direction is "a cleanly printed paper form, with deviations for
usability".

**Type scale.** Four tokens, one job each: `--fs-name` 14px (names, primary rows),
`--fs-field` 13px (form controls and table data), `--fs-meta` 12px (secondary text,
hints, header controls), `--fs-ctl` 11px (Oswald labels). Replaced eight Jost sizes
running 9–14px, several differing by half a pixel. Tiny caret/glyph sizes (9px) are
left alone — they aren't text.

**Fonts.** Three roles confirmed: Fraunces display headings, Oswald labels, Jost
everything else. **Every Oswald label is 11px / 1.2px tracking** — one size, one
tracking, no exceptions. Case is *not* forced: uppercasing field labels made them
~40% wider and wrapped them out of the label column, so `label`, `.pill` and
`.posn-dept-badge` keep their natural case.

**Header controls are Jost, not Oswald.** Select all, Filter, Expand/Collapse all,
Summary and the row-level All are things you click, not captions — `--fs-meta`,
sentence case, no tracking. Oswald's uppercase tracking made them read as headings.

**Font loading.** Fraunces requests 700 only (500 was loaded and never used).
`.dept-code` dropped from Jost 700 — which was never in the request and rendered as
synthetic bold — to the 600 used everywhere else.

**Fields are ruled lines, not boxes.** No fill, no border, no radius: a single
`--field-line` rule under the writing area only. Because the label sits in its own
column the rule starts where the writing starts, which is what marks a field as
fillable. 13px text, 6px/8px padding. Focus turns the rule brand green via
`box-shadow` so nothing shifts as you tab. `select.pill-select` is now the same
control — same Jost, same size, same rule — instead of a green pill.

**Two line weights, and they are not interchangeable.** `--line` is
`rgba(17,10,8,.10)` for *drawn divisions* (heading rules, table cells). `--field-line`
is `rgba(17,10,8,.30)` for *form fields*. A 10% line is too faint to read as "fill this
in", so fields need their own weight — don't collapse these back together.

**Checkboxes are an X on a box that never changes fill.** `appearance:none` plus a
`::after` `\00D7`. `accent-color` is gone.

⚠️ **Superseded by Phase Bulk Edit for the mobile day-chips specifically** (`.crewgrid-check`
under `@media(max-width:900px)`, D1/D2/…/Pre on Days on site, Hotel and Catering): they
no longer match the checkbox pattern above. Showing both the X *and* a darker outline on
the same chip read as two signals for one state, so checked is now a single filled-dark
chip (`background:var(--text)`) with no `::after` mark at all, and the chip itself
shrank (`min-height:32px`, `padding:0 7px`, `border-radius:0` — square, not pill-shaped)
so up to 7 fit one row on a phone-width screen without wrapping. The plain-checkbox
pattern in this paragraph still holds everywhere else, including desktop's
`.crewgrid-check` (a real 16×16 checkbox, unstyled).

**Sections have no frame** (model C). No border, no fill, no padding — the Pattern A
heading rule divides, margin spaces. `.formgroup` likewise. Boxes are kept *only*
where one means something: `.card` (the call sheet preview — a sheet of paper, and it
carries a stronger 20% border so it reads as one), dialogs, transient panels
(`.filter-panel`, `.bulk-edit-panel`) and open editing states.

**No drawn line between rows.** `.crewgrid-row`, `.roles-grid-row`,
`.crewgrid-catering-person` and `.cam-row` have no bottom rule — the department
heading does the dividing. This took Crew from 55 drawn dividers to 0, and Catering
from 121 to 0. Table cells in Preview & Export keep theirs: that is functional row
structure on a document that gets printed, not decoration.

**The row-level "All" is one control in one place** — a Jost text link in the row's
final column, on Days/Hotel *and* Catering. Previously a bordered button on the right
for Days/Hotel and a left-hand Oswald text link for Catering.

**Two greens, one hue.** `--tape` `#017756` for light backgrounds, `--tape-light`
`#0FA47A` for dark. The sidebar uses `--tape-light`: 6.17:1 versus 3.52:1 for the
brand green, so active items clear AA. No warm secondary hue was added.
⚠️ Lightening the sidebar instead is *not* a middle option — brand green only reaches
4.5:1 against backgrounds lighter than about `#E8E8E8`, and it gets worse before it
gets better (1.24:1 against mid-grey `#777`). A lighter sidebar means a near-white
one, which also forces the sidebar text from ivory to ink.

**Left alone by decision.** Tech Specs still flows rather than aligning — the short
values justify it. The icon set is unchanged, including the three unused icons.

### Fixed here: the tint tokens were dead

Commit `50238c5` rewrote `rgba(1,119,86,…)` → `var(--tint-N)` with a `sed` that also
hit the `:root` declarations, leaving `--tint-1:var(--tint-1)` and so on. A
self-referential custom property is invalid at computed-value time, so **all four
tints resolved to transparent from `50238c5` until this phase** — every panel tint,
badge fill and editing-state highlight was silently absent. Restored to literals.
Lesson: never `sed` a token name across a file that also contains its definition.

## The design system, as decided (Phase Style Review)

> Superseded in places by the Phase Fonts section above — notably boxes (sections now
> have none), inputs (now ruled lines, not filled boxes), the sidebar green, and the
> row dividers. Read that section first.


The audit's exported decisions are now applied to `index.html`. This is the reference
for what the app's styling *should* be — check here before adding a new heading,
label or box, rather than copying whatever the nearest element happens to do.

**Pattern A — the one tab-entry heading.** Fraunces 700 15px, brand green, with a
thin grey rule that starts after the words and sits on their vertical centre. Green
at rest, **black on hover** (the inverse of the old behaviour). Used by `.section h2`,
`.sd-block-head` (shoot-day blocks and the Hotel/Catering/Transport/Tech summary
blocks) and `.posn-company-header`. The old 20px-black-with-thick-green-underline and
14px-black-with-black-underline variants are gone. Where a header carries a trailing
action (Preview & Export's Copy buttons), the rule lives on the inner
`.sd-block-head-toggle` so it sits *between* the title and the button.

**Page headline.** `.page-head h1` is Fraunces 700 22px **uppercase**, with the
company/client line beneath it in `--body`, upper-and-lower-case, muted — the
preview-card (`.card .line1` + `.sub`) pattern. The eyebrow moved *below* the h1 in
all five `.page-head` call sites; it is no longer an uppercase eyebrow above.

**Label family.** One look for every small uppercase label: Oswald 11px, 1.2px
tracking, uppercase, brand green, **no bottom border**. Block-level section labels
(`.subhead`, `.card h3`, `.modal-box h3`, `.formgroup > .fg-title`) also carry the
Pattern A trailing rule; column and table headers (`.crewgrid-header`,
`.roles-grid-header`, `.section th`, `.ki-item h4`, `.meal-row-label`) take the type
but no rule. Header *controls* (`.crew-header-row`, `.filter-toggle`,
`.dept-toggle-all`) stay muted grey — they're controls, not captions — but share the
same font, size and tracking, and go green on hover.

**Names.** Person names and record titles are `--body` (Jost) 600 **14px**
everywhere — `.list-card .meta strong`, `.crew-ident-top strong`,
`.crew-ident.one-line strong`, `.roles-grid-name`, `.cam-who strong`. Fraunces is now
reserved for display headings only. Note this also restyles location titles, since
they share `.list-card .meta strong`.

**Fields sit on a line, not stacked.** In `.grid` and `.grid.g2`, any `<div>` that
leads with a `<label>` becomes a two-column row: a fixed `--field-label-w` (104px)
label column so rows align down the page, then the control. Anything after the label
stacks inside the control column. Deliberately **not** applied to `.g3`/`.g4` — those
cells are already narrow and a 104px label column leaves ~55px for the control, which
clips dates and times; dense rows keep the label above. Bare labels outside a `.grid`
(log line, notes, descriptions) stay full-width stacked. Everything reverts to stacked
below 900px. `.ts-field` and `.field-inline` were duplicates and are now one rule set.

**Boxes.** White fill, `--box-radius` 8px, `--box-pad` 10px. `.card` (call sheet
preview, a document) and `.modal-box` (a dialog) keep 16px padding as deliberate
exceptions. `.list-card` lost its mint fill. Faint green panel tints stay on
`.filter-panel` / `.bulk-edit-panel` / `.formgroup` / `.day-override-form`.

**Green tints.** Nine hand-written `rgba(1,119,86,…)` values collapsed to four
tokens: `--tint-1` .03 (panels), `--tint-2` .05 (editing/overridden rows), `--tint-3`
.10 (badges, hover fills), `--tint-4` .14 (active controls — must stay distinct from
tint-3). Two deliberate one-offs remain inline: `.35` for the sidebar active gradient
and `.28` for selected role / HoD pills.

**Colour.** No drifted hexes — the mint `#5fd6ac` and sage `#e2ede8` are gone.
⚠️ The sidebar now uses brand green `#017756` on the near-black background, which
measures **~3.5:1** against the required 4.5:1 for 13px text (the mint it replaced
measured 10.9:1). This was flagged and chosen knowingly for brand purity; if active
sidebar items read too dim, the fix is a named `--tape-light` token rather than a
return to a stray hex.

**Expand/collapse.** One toggling text control, never two links side by side:
`expandCollapseAllHTML(fnName, arg, extraLinkHTML, allCollapsed)` renders "Expand all"
while everything is collapsed and "Collapse all" otherwise, so only the available
action shows. Callers pass current state. The Phase V rotating chevron is gone; the
`.expandall-caret` rule was removed with it.

**Left alone by decision.** Divider weights (schedule stays dashed — it's uniquely
alterable; crew/camera stay solid). Unused `crew`/`location`/`menu` icons and the
burger's hardcoded SVG stay as they are. `--mono` is now plain
`ui-monospace, monospace` — the never-loaded JetBrains Mono name was dropped rather
than the font being added.

**Open for the next round:** a fonts-only review. One thing to fold in — Fraunces is
loaded at weights 500 and 700 only (see the Google Fonts `<link>`), but every display
rule asks for 600 or 700; the 600s are being synthesised rather than using a real cut.
